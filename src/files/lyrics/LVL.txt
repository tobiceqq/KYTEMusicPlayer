Yeah, you claim you rage, you hatin' like you live in Oakland
All my rap town n*ggas with the roof back
Introduce you n*ggas to the new swag
Make you say a n*gga blew up too fast
F*ck I'm 'sposed to do with all this new ass?
F*ck I'm 'sposed to do with all this new cash?
Thousand dollar drawers just to hold my balls
All I ever do is let my jewels sag
Pac gone, but the "Juice" back
Get your popcorn, juice, snacks
It's a movie, n*gga, with a new cast
Get the news flash, that the truth back
This is boom bap, mixed with new raps
Look at all the n*ggas that I blew past
Hood by Air, to the do-rag
N*gga make way for the new jacks

All this talk of Illuminati ain't got a clue about me (Uh)
B*tch, I'm Trillmaluminati and got my crew behind me (Alright)
Shooters 'round me (Yeah), keep them looters 'round me (Uh)
Keep a tool around me (Uh), it'll keep you fools from 'round me (Uh)
Couple of them dudes surround me
With a gat, with a strap in a backpack
When they cap, cap, leave you flat, better back, back
On a fast track, ratatat, n*gga, that's that
N*gga, pass that, finna ash, where the hash at
Got a Kat Stacks with an ass, finna smash that
Make 'em catch that, A$AP, then I pass that
Off to my n*ggas then she ask, "Where the cash at?"
Uh, I see dead people (Uh), I need dead people (Uh)
Lord Pretty Flacko, b*tch, I behead people (Uh)
Kneel and kiss the ring (Yeah), all hail the King (Yeah)
Long Live A$AP put that on everything (Uh)
