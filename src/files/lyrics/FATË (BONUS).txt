[Part I]

[Chorus]
(Ah-woo, h-h-hey, s-s-s—)
Ridin' with my window-indows down on this b*tch (I seen a thousand things), yeah, down on this b*tch (I seen a thousand things)
Ridin' in this b*tch (Ah-woo), 'round town on this b*tch (I seen a thousand things, I seen a thousand things)
I was sellin' hope, yeah, I was sellin' faith, ah (I seen a thousand things)
But make no mistake (Ah-woo), ah, you can't choose your fate, ah (I seen a thousand things)
You can't choose your fate, ah, you can't choose your fate, huh (Ah-woo, I seen a thousand things)
Just keep drivin', I keep drivin' life (I seen a thousand things)
Seen the way I died, then I watched it on rewind
When I was young (Ah-woo), I seen a alien in my life (I seen a thousand things)
And it told me what to do, yeah, they came late at night
And the crib was shakin' (Ah-woo), felt like earthquakes in the night
But the ship ain't hit my house and it had told me what to—
Told me— Told me what to do, told me what to do (I seen a thousand things)
Maybe I'm really not from this Earth

[Verse]
I got what I dеserve, I put in all that work
My diamonds shinin', diamonds shinin' from this Earth
Everything go pеrf', and it's on, they surf
I can't feel a— feel a thing, not from this Earth
I had to roll my turf, I had to hold my spot
I had to hold my Glock, yeah, I gotta point the Glock
I seen time stop, I seen a thousand things
I seen a thousand things, I seen a thousand things
Look into my eyes, you'll see a thousand things
You'll see a thousand things, you'll see a thousand things

[Chorus]
(Ah-woo, h-h-hey, s-s-s—)
Ridin' with my window-indows down on this b*tch (I seen a thousand things), yeah, down on this b*tch (I seen a thousand things)
Ridin' in this b*tch (Ah-woo), 'round town on this b*tch (I seen a thousand things, I seen a thousand things)
I was sellin' hope, yeah, I was sellin' faith, ah (I seen a thousand things)
But make no mistake (Ah-woo), ah, you can't choose your fate, ah (I seen a thousand things)
You can't choose your fate, ah, you can't choose your fate, huh (Ah-woo, I seen a thousand things)
Just keep drivin', I keep drivin' life (I seen a thousand things)
Seen the way I died, then I watched it on rewind
When I was young (Ah-woo), I seen a alien in my life (I seen a thousand things)
And it told me what to do, yeah, they came late at night
And the crib was shakin' (Ah-woo), felt like earthquakes in the night
But the ship ain't hit my house and it had told me what to—
Told me— Told me what to do, told me what to do (I seen a thousand things)
Maybe I'm really not from this Earth

[Outro]
I seen a thousand things
I seen a thousand things

[Part II]

[Verse]
I'ma end this off on a good note (Yeah)
I hope you ready for A DANGEROUS LYFE
Hope you get ready, I won't tell you twice, ah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
It's a bad world, bad world for you, bad world for me
I'm a drug addict, I can't stay asleep
I was out my mind, I was on the tweak
If it's a dangerous life for you, then it's a dangerous life for me, yeah (Oh)
I can't handle shit (Yeah, oh-oh), I can't handle shit, yeah (Yeah, yeah)
I had to feel (I'ma lay off the tweak)
